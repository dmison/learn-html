<h2 style="margin-top:0px;">Welcome to Learning HTML & CSS</h2>

The purpose of this workshop is to teach you HTML and CSS, the two core languages used to make webpages.

We assume very little except enthusiasm and a basic familiarity with your computer and a web browser.

### Why Learn HTML & CSS?

If you want to build websites you need to know this.  But even if you don't, knowing a little bit about how web pages work can help you in your day-to-day interactions with websites as you realise a little more about what is going on.

### What we are going to do

This workshop has a bunch of steps.  Starting with some raw content for a three page website we show you step by step how to make those raw material into functioning webpages.

Sound good?  Then letâ€™s go.
